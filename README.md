## 📄 Abstract

Human factors represent a critical vulnerability in cybersecurity, as many security incidents are driven by user behaviour rather than technical failures. This research paper studies human behavioural factors influencing cybersecurity outcomes, including cognitive limitations, risk assessment, usability, and social challenges.

The study identifies common patterns such as vulnerability to social engineering, security fatigue, and inconsistent policy compliance — drawing on interdisciplinary literature from cybersecurity, psychology, and human-computer interaction. The paper further explores the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on user behaviour, highlighting risks of over-dependence and reduced user engagement.

The paper argues for **human-centred, behaviour-informed security design** to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of cybersecurity defences.

## Introduction

The paper addresses the persistent gap between the advancement of technical cybersecurity tools (firewalls, encryption, IDS, MFA) and the continued rise in cyber attacks. It argues that human behaviour — not technology — is the weakest link, and that addressing this requires an interdisciplinary approach combining psychology, human-computer interaction, and security design.

## Key Findings

### 🧠 Human Vulnerabilities & Behavioural Patterns
- **Psychological factors** — cognitive biases, personality differences, and behavioural risk factors
- **Social engineering** — exploitation of urgency, fear, authority, and curiosity (BEC, phishing, financial fraud)
- **Security awareness gap** — increased knowledge does not automatically translate into secure behaviour
- **Individual & demographic differences** — non-IT professionals and non-Gen Z users show higher vulnerability

### 📊 Key Insight: Awareness vs. Compliance Gap

| Area | Awareness/Knowledge | Actual Compliance |
|---|---|---|
| Password Management | 85% | 30% |
| Phishing Detection | 95% | 45% |
| Data Handling | 85% | 45% |

---

## Positive Factors

- **Emotional Intelligence & Critical Thinking** — effective defences against social engineering
- **Self-Efficacy & Motivation** — confident users are more likely to engage in secure practices
- **Organizational Support** — leadership involvement drives a culture of shared security responsibility
- **Cybersecurity Awareness Programs** — most effective when they address emotional, cognitive, and behavioural components together

---

## Human-Centric Approaches

- **Human + AI Collaboration** — humans provide contextual judgment; AI provides speed and pattern recognition
- **Psychological Resilience Training** — gamified learning and decision-support systems reduce vulnerabilities
- **Organizational Culture Development** — security as shared responsibility, not just IT compliance

---

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity failures are as much a human problem as a technical one. This paper demonstrates that an integrated approach — one that combines understanding of human behaviour with technological solutions — is essential for building resilient cybersecurity defences. Future research should continue to promote human-centric security models.
